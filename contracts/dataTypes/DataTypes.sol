    // Keep track of account insertions
    // Record relationship rules as Follows:
    // 1. Every Account is the root of a mapping tree in the diagram below:
    // 2. Every Account can be a Patreon, And/or Sponsor, and/or Agent
    //    - A Patreon is the, primary steak Holder of the "Sponsor Coin" token.
    //        The primary purpose of holding "Sponsor Coins" is to share "Proof of Stake"
    //        percentage earnings with the selected sopnsor(s).
    //    - A Sponsor is considered to be a child of one or more Patreons with the purposes
    //      of sharing "Proof of Stake" Patreon rewards.
    //    - An Agent finds Patreon(s) for any specific sponsor and receives a share of the 
    //      "Proof of Stake" reward allocation for this effort. 
    // 3. Every Account can be a Patrion, Sponsor and/or agent to one or more mutually 
    //    exclusive account(s).
    // 4. Every Sponsor can have a number of Patreon(s), Sponsor(s) and/or Agent(s)
    // 5. Every Sponsor has an array of rate structures
    // 6. Every Agent has an array of rate structures
    // 7. Every Rate Structure has an array of Transactions
    // 8. Each Patreon/Sponsor/Agent "MUST BE" mutually exclusive
    //    - This implies no two accounts can be the same for each account structure
    //
    //  The following is a brief diagram of the contractural structure.
